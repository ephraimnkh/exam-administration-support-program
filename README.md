#exam-administration-support-system

This was my final assignment for my Computer Programming 2 Module. 

It was a system to help the examination department of a school to manage examination information.

This program has two implementations. One command line implementation in MainProgram and One GUI implemetation in ExamGUI.

You can view this package in BlueJ.
